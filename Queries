1.Retrieve the top 3 donors along with their names and the total quantity of items 
they have donated.

select donor_name, total_donation_quantity from
(select d.name as donor_name,sum(di.quantity) as total_donation_quantity from donors d 
join transactions t on d.donor_id = t.donor_id
 join donated_items di on t.transaction_id = di.transaction_id
 group by d.donor_id, d.name
 order by total_donation_quantity desc) where rownum <= 3;

2.Find the top 4 recipients who have received the most deliveries, along with their 
names and delivery counts.

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT r.name AS recipient_name, COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS delivery_count
 FROM recipients r
 JOIN transactions t ON r.recipient_id = t.recipient_id
 GROUP BY r.recipient_id, r.name
 ORDER BY delivery_count DESC
)WHERE
ROWNUM<=4;

3.Retrieve the categories of food items that have expired, along with the count of 
expired items in each category.

SELECT fi.category, COUNT(fi.item_id) AS expired_item_count
FROM food_items fi WHERE
fi.expiration_date <= SYSDATE
GROUP BY 
fi.category;

4.Find the names of donors and their most recent donation dates.

SELECT d.name AS donor_name,
MAX(t.transaction_date) AS most_recent_donation
FROM donors d JOIN transactions t ON d.donor_id = t.donor_id
GROUP BY
 d.name;

5.Calculate the average donation quantity per donor and sort the results in 
descending/any order.

SELECT d.name AS donor_name, AVG(di.quantity) AS avg_donation_quantity
FROM donors d JOIN transactions t ON d.donor_id = t.donor_id
JOIN donated_items di ON t.transaction_id = di.transaction_id
GROUP BY
 d.name
ORDER BY
 d.name;

 6.Find the names of recipients who have received donations with a total quantity 
greater than 100

SELECT r.name AS recipient_name FROM recipients r
JOIN transactions t ON r.recipient_id = t.recipient_id
JOIN donated_items di ON t.transaction_id = di.transaction_id
GROUP BY r.recipient_id, r.name
HAVING
SUM(di.quantity) > 100;

7. Count the total number of donated items across all transactions till july.

SELECT SUM(di.quantity) AS total_donated_items
FROM donated_items di
JOIN transactions t ON di.transaction_id = t.transaction_id
WHERE t.transaction_date <= DATE '2023-07-31';
